# GRAD521_DMPMedina_2021

Contest of the project for this DMP:

After a century of protection and isolation from nearby mainland forests, Barro Colorado Island (BCI) has lost 30% of its original breeding bird species. To understand the cause of this decline, our research  proposes an assessment of how environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation influence loss of bird species in forests of Central Panama, particularly on BCI. We will analyze patterns of species loss with respect to physiological traits by non-invasively studying 248 species currently or historically residing in BCI and Soberania National Park (SNP) for mainland comparison. We will do so by measuring the physical characteristics of museum specimens and recording environmental conditions at selected locations. After associating species loss with altered climatic conditions, we will generate projection models that assess species vulnerability to future changes in climate.
