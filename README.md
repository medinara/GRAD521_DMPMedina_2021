# GRAD521_DMPMedina_2021

Context of the project for this DMP:

After a century of protection and isolation from nearby mainland forests, Barro Colorado Island (BCI) has lost 30% of its original breeding bird species. To understand the cause of this decline, our research  proposes an assessment of how environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and precipitation influence loss of bird species in forests of Central Panama, particularly on BCI. We will analyze patterns of species loss with respect to physiological traits by non-invasively studying 248 species currently or historically residing in BCI and Soberania National Park (SNP) for mainland comparison. We will do so by measuring the physical characteristics of museum specimens and recording environmental conditions at selected locations. After associating species loss with altered climatic conditions, we will generate projection models that assess species vulnerability to future changes in climate. 

Data Description:
Our analysis will require the relationship between two datasets that we intend to collect separately. The first data we will collect is the bird physiology data, which includes measurements of body length, width, height, body mass, feather length, feather depth, feather absorptance, and feather reflectance. All body measurements will be taken with a measuring tape and body mass will be obtained from the VerNet website since we cant obtain body mass from collection specimens. Feather reflectance and absorptance will be obtained using a spectroradiometer, tungsten halogen light, and a reflection probe holder. Measurements will be taken on three individual birds for 280 bird species and will be recorded as a numerical value. We will obtain these measurements from specimens at the Smithsonian, the American Museum of Natural History, Louisiana State University, and other collections with tropical specimens available. For the collection process we are creating a data sheet for us to record measurements by hand and then entering it to an Excel spreadsheet. This data will probably take less than 1-2 GB of space. 
The second data set we will collect is environmental data in order to complete our biophysical models. Our environmental data will be collected in Central Panama at Barro Colorado Island and Soberania National Park. We will compare the environmental conditions on Barro Colorado Island, where many species have been lost, with the adjacent Soberania National Park, where they have not. We will collect data during seasonal extremes, focusing on April, the hot and dry month, and September, a wetter and cooler month. We expect to collect measurements for temperature and humidity using Measurement Computing USB-500-LCD temperature/humidity loggers distributed in random locations. On selected sites, loggers will also be placed vertically at three height categories: ground (<1 m); understory (>1 m but below the canopy); and canopy (top level of vegetation regardless of height). Temperature and humidity will be recorded everyday for the entire month of fieldwork. Our data will be recorded with the loggers so we can input the data straight into the computer. However, we do expect to regularly check the loggers to ensure they are working properly.
